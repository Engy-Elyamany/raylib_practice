## Study Updates 
### To Do
1. Window intialization and closing ✅
2. Drawing shapes ✅
3. collision ✅
4. Sound effects
5. Game states (menu, playing, game over)
6. Simple physics (gravity, jumping, speed)✅
7. Adding Images, background images and sprites


### [ Tuesday, 17-6-2025,  02:15 (hours:minutes) ] :
1. Set Raylib on my device successfully (Took forever)
2. Learned the basics of InitWindow, BeginDrawing, key Control , colors
3. Drew a simple circle and controlled its movment through keyboard keys

### [ Wednesday 18-6-2025  00:00 ] :
DID NOTHING


### [ Thursday 19-6-2025  03:34 ] :
1. Drew Basic shapes, Vector2 
2. Collision between two rectangles (one fixed and other is moving)

3. Preventing collision (a bit rusty but got the fundamentals)

#### Study materials :
- Took only the physics part from here 
[core automation events](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/examples/core/core_automation_events.c)
